1. first change let for const and made them as functions

2. Document Fragment: it's used to minimize DOM 
it's the first thing observable over here
when the reflows and repaints by appending multiple 
elements in memory before adding them to the DOM 
in one operation.

3. innerHTML: Using textContent is generally safer 
and faster when inserting plain text.

4. Array Method forEach: used to iterate over the array, 
which is more concise and readable than a `for` loop.
This optimized approach improves performance by reducing 
the number of times the DOM is updated and ensuring 
that all changes are batched together.

1. Single Query: Replace the loop that fetches
 products one-by-one with a single database query 
 that retrieves all products at once. 
 This significantly reduces the number of database 
 round-trips, improving performance and reducing 
 load on the database.

2. Assumptions: This solution assumes the database 
object has a method getAllProducts that fetches 
all products in one go. 

3. Dependency Injection: is injected via the 
constructor. This makes the class easier to test it
and more flexible.
   
4. Final Keyword:the db is marked as "final" to 
indicate that it should not be reassigned after 
initialization, enhancing immutability and 
thread-safety.

1. This method is used to project each element 
of a sequence into a new form. It provides a 
concise and efficient way to process each element 
in the list.

2. Conditional Operator "?" is used within 
the "Select" method to handle the odd check and 
respective multiplication in a single line.

3.ToList Method converts the result for the Select 
method back into a integer List
This approach simplifies the code, making it more 
readable and potentially more efficient by leveraging 
the optimized internal implementations of LINQ methods.
