# Project name: Shein-shoppingTime

############ Description ############
## User Management 
handles all tasks related to user registration, 
authentication, profile management, and user 
data storage for authentication.

## Product Catalog 
manages product listings, including categories,
subcategories, such as season clothes, gender clothes.
Search functionality such as name clothes. Product details
, such as color clothes, size. Inventory, 
and pricing.

## Order Processing 
oversees shopping cart management, order creation, 
payment processing, order tracking, and order history.

## Customer Support 
provides features for customer queries, support tickets, 
live chat, and feedback.
All these functionalities are integrated into a single 
codebase and share the same database. This means any update 
or change to one part of the application potentially impacts 
the entire system. The application's components are tightly 
coupled, making it challenging to scale or modify individual 
parts independently.

############ Migration Roadmap ############
Let's define the Roadmap by phases...

### Phase 1: Preparation and Planning
## 1. Assess the current monolithic system (diagram)
Define business goals and objectives for migration.
Identify critical components and dependencies.

## 2. Define microservice boundaries using domain-driven design
Choose the technology stack and tools, in this case Docker.
which is one of the best ones for e-commerce services
Set up a basic infrastructure for microservices CI/CD pipeline, 
container orchestration.

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup
## 1. Set up containerization with Docker
Configure Kubernetes for orchestration.
Implement API Gateway and service discovery mechanisms.

## 2. Set up centralized logging, monitoring, and alerting systems
Create a development environment for microservices.
Begin designing APIs for each microservice.

### Phase 3: Service Decomposition and Development
## 1. User Management Microservice
Extract user registration, authentication, and profile management.
Develop and deploy the User Management service.
Redirect user-related traffic from the monolith to the new service.
Test thoroughly and monitor performance.

## 2. Product Catalog Microservice
Extract product listings, categories, search functionality, and inventory.
Develop and deploy the Product Catalog service.
Redirect relevant traffic from the monolith.
Conduct integration and performance tests.

## 3. Extract shopping cart management, order creation, payment processing, and tracking.
Develop and deploy the Order Processing service.
Redirect order-related traffic.
Perform extensive testing and monitoring.

## 4. Customer Support Microservice
Extract customer queries, support tickets, live chat, and feedback.
Develop and deploy the Customer Support service.
Redirect support-related traffic.
Test and ensure stability.

### Phase 4: Data Migration and Consistency
## 1. Implement data synchronization between the monolithic database and microservice databases.
Use strategies like event sourcing or CQRS for data consistency.
Perform data migration for each service incrementally.
Validate data integrity and ensure consistency across services.

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation
## 1. Conduct unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for each microservice.
Perform load and performance testing to identify and address bottlenecks.
Regularly monitor the system for issues and resolve them promptly.

### Phase 6: Deployment and Rollout
## 1. Deploy microservices incrementally using the CI/CD pipeline.
Implement blue-green deployments or canary releases to minimize risks.
Monitor the live environment closely and ensure a smooth transition.

### Phase 7: Final Cutover and Cleanup
## 1. Conduct the final cutover from the monolithic application to microservices.
Retire the monolithic application.
Clean up any legacy code and data structures.
Review and optimize the microservices setup for performance and scalability.

## 2. Ongoing Maintenance and Optimization
Regularly update and maintain microservices.
Optimize for performance and scalability.
Stay responsive to user feedback and make necessary improvements.
